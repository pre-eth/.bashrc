# .bashrc

My .bashrc that I use everyday. Hope there's some things in here that you can take away :) 

Feel free to suggest add-ons or improvements too!!

UPDATE: I've switched to macOS so now I've included my current .zshrc as well. I probably won't update the .bashrc much anymore if at all, but will leave it here anyway.
